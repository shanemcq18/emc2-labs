# Lab 18: Networks and Eigenvector Centrality

In this lab, you will learn how we model real-world networks as mathematical objects and adjacency matrices.
You will also learn how to compute the importance of nodes in a network using [PageRank Centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), which is the basis of Google's search algorithm.

## Graph Theory Background

Graph theory is the study of mathematical structures called graph (networks), which consist of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
These graphs can represent relationships between objects—-like friendships between people, roads between cities, or links between web pages.
At its core, graph theory explores how these connections form patterns and what those patterns tell us about the underlying structure.


We can apply networks for studying the internet: we model websites as nodes in the graph which are connected by various hyperlinks acting as edges.
Networks like this have traditionally allowed search engines such as Google to rank pages based on importance or relevance.
In this lab we will walk you through this process of finding the importance of pages.


## Adjacency Matrices

Throughout this lab we will use a directed network to represent the *internet*.
We will start with a matrix of directed edges, where each row contains a starting page and its corresponding ending page.
It will be a $m \times 2$ matrix appearing like,

```{math}
\left[
\begin{matrix} 
76 & 109 \\
76 & 4 \\ 
76 & 78 \\
\vdots & \vdots
\end{matrix}
\right]
```
For example, this small snippet shows us that page 76 has hyperlinks to page 109, 4, and 78.
Now, we can take this vector and transform it into a much more useful form of data called an adjacency matrix.
This matrix is $n \times n$ with $n$ nodes.
In this matrix, each row corresponds to a starting page, and each column corresponds to an ending page.
Therefore every $(i,j)$ position of the adjacency matrix will be a directed edge from node $v_i$ to node $v_j$

```{image} _static/directed_network.PNG
:align: center
```
Consider the directed network above. It contains 5 nodes, and can be represented by the following $5 \times 5$ adjacency matrix,

```{math}
\left[
\begin{matrix} 
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 
\end{matrix}
\right]
```
Notice the 2 in the 4th row, 3rd column, since there are two edges traveling from node 3 to node 2.
Also, notice that there are no non-zero entries in the last row, which corresponds to the fact that node 4 does not have any edges which start from it.

:::{admonition} Task 1
:class: exercise

Define a function `adj_matrix(edge_matrix)`.
This function should take a $m \times 2$  `np.array` and return the respective $n \times n$ adjacency matrix.
Note that because each node is represented by a number between $0$ and $n-1$, use `np.max()` and add 1 to find the size of the adjacency matrix.
If you are confused on how to set up the adjacency matrix, refer to the notes above.

## PageRank Centrality

For the next part of the lab, we are going to explore how Google and other companies actually determine the importance of pages through PageRank Centrality.
For the next part of the lab consider the network below.

```{image} _static/directed_network_gprime.PNG
:align: center
```
The adjacency matrix for this network is defined by

```{math}
\left[
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right]
```
The basis of PageRank Centrality is that the importance of every node, $x_i$, is determined by the importance of the nodes pointing towards it.
Basically, to measure a node's importance, sum the importance of each node pointing to it, divided by the number of nodes they point to.
Consider node $1$. Only node $0$ is pointing towards it, and this node points to only one other node.
Hence $x_1 = x_0$, or the importance of node $1$ is equal to the importance of node $0$.
Now look at node $7$. Only node $6$ is pointing there, but node $6$ is pointing to two different nodes.
Hence $x_7 = \frac{1}{2} x_6$.
If we continue this for all of the nodes in our network we get the following set of equations.

```{math}
\begin{array}{cc}
x_0 = \frac{1}{2}x_4  + \frac{1}{4}x_2 + x_5 + x_7 & x_4 = \frac{1}{2} x_3 \\
x_1 = x_0 & x_5 =  \frac{1}{2}x_6 + \frac{1}{4}x_2 + \frac{1}{2}x_3 \\
x_2 = x_1 + \frac{1}{2}x_4 & x_6 = \frac{1}{4}x_2 \\
x_3 = \frac{1}{4}x_2 & x_7 = \frac{1}{2} x_6
\end{array}
```
Now we can represent these as a system of equations to solve for the importance of each node.

```{math}
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x_0\\ x_1\\ x_2\\ x_3\\ x_4\\ x_5\\ x_6\\ x_7
\end{array}
\right]
=
\left[
\begin{array}{cccccccc}
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1}{4} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
x_0\\ x_1\\ x_2\\ x_3\\ x_4\\ x_5\\ x_6\\ x_7
\end{array}
\right]
.
```
Now we have a matrix of the form $x=Px$ or $Px=x$ where $x$ is the importance of each vector.
As you can see, we are solving for an eigenvector whose corresponding $\lambda$ is 1.

:::{note}
This matrix is a [stochastic matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix), because each column of the matrix sums to one.
By the [Perron-Frobenius theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem)
we are guaranteed that if a matrix's columns all sum up to 1 and all entries are non-negative, then
there exists an eigenvalue of 1 and associated eigenvector.
:::
In [Lab 9](https://emc2.byu.edu/fall-labs/lab09.html), we used iterative methods to solve for the solution of systems of equations.
One of these methods is the [Power Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration) which is an iterative method that solves for the dominant eigenvector of a system of equations.
It is defined by the equation below:

```{math}
x_{k+1} = \frac{Px_k}{||Px_k||}
```
Now consider the vector below whose column adds up to 1.

```{math}
x_0 = 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
1/8 \\
1/8 \\
1/8 \\
1/8 \\
1/8 \\
1/8 \\
1/8 \\
1/8
\end{array}
\right].
```
Because $P$ is a column stochastic matrix, as long as the entries of $x_k$ are non-negative and add up to one, the entries of $x_{k+1}$ will also add up to one and be non-negative,
and the Power Method becomes $x_{k+1} = Px_k$.
Therefore, we can generalize the equation to $x_{k} = P^{k}x_0$.
Like all iterative methods, as we increase the amount of iterations, the iterate becomes more and more accurate.

:::{admonition} Task 2
:class: exercise


Define a function `stoch_mat(A)` which will take an adjacency matrix `A` and returns the corresponding stochastic matrix.
You can calculate the stochastic matrix by dividing each row of the matrix by the sum of the row, and then transpose the matrix using `A.T`.

:::

::::{admonition} Task 3
:class: exercise


Define a function `stoch_eig(P, k)` which takes a `n x n` stochastic matrix `P` and number of iterations `k`
and returns the dominant eigenvector of `P` after `k` iterations.
You will need to start with `x_0 = np.array([1/n, 1/n, ... , 1/n]) = np.full(n, 1/n)` with `n` entries.
Remember the equation $x_{k} = P^{k}x_0$.

:::{note}
The numpy function `np.full(shape, value)` takes in a shape, `n` for one dimensional vectors and `(m, n)` for multi-dimensional matrices,
and fills it in with the fill value.

```python
>>> np.full(5, 10)
[10 10 10 10 10]
```

```python
>>> np.full((2,3), 4)
[[4 4 4]
[4 4 4]]
```

:::{admonition} Task 4
:class: exercise


Define a function `PageRank_cent(edge_matrix, k)` that combines all of your past functions to find the page rank centrality of a network with a given edgematrix and a number of iterations.
You will first need to take `edge_matrix` and convert it to an adjacency matrix using the `adj_matrix` function.
Then convert the adjacency matrix to a stochastic matrix using the `stoch_mat` function.
Finally, use the `stoch_eig` function to return the dominant eigenvector after `k` iterations.

:::{admonition} Task 5
:class: exercise


Use your recently created `PageRank_cent` to find the index of the most important node of a 499-node network (given in codebuddy).
You can use `np.argmax()` to find the index of the largest element in an array.

## Conclusion

Using the Power Method to compute the PageRank scores was the foundation of Google’s search ranking results for many years.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the original developers of this algorithm.
The PageRank algorithm is known to converge quite quickly.
In their original paper, Brin and Page reported that on a network with 322 million edges the algorithm converged to usable values within 52 iterations.

Finally, as a historical note, the patent for the PageRank algorithm is owned by Stanford University (where Brin and Page were students at the time they developed it).
Stanford granted Google exclusive license rights to use the algorithm, in exchange for 1.8 million shares of Google which Stanford sold in 2005 for $336 million.
Today those shares would be worth approximately $3.8 billion, all for an algorithm that computes an eigenvector!

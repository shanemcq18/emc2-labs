# Lab 24: Least Squares Lab


In this lab you will use least squares to obtain "lines of best fit" in regression tasks.
You will need to import the following:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import numpy.linalg as la
>>> from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
```

In various scientific domains, experimental data is used to infer mathematical relationships between input variables and associated outputs.
We have a set of data points $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are the inputs and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are the associated outputs.
We desire a function that approximates the mapping from inputs (i.e., independent variables) to outputs (i.e., dependent variables).
This task is referred to as **regression**; it is ubiquitous in data-driven modeling and can be solved via the method of least squares.

## Polynomial Regression

For simplicity, let's consider the degree $p$ **polynomial regression** in the 1-D case, where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$.

To review least squares for polynomial regression, let $y := (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector of output coefficients and let $X$ denote the polynomial data matrix

```{math}
X = \begin{pmatrix}
   x_1^p & x_1^{p-1} & \ldots & x_1 & 1 \\
   x_2^p & x_2^{p-1} & \ldots & x_2 & 1 \\
   \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
   x_n^p & x_n^{p-1} & \ldots & x_n & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (p+1)}.
```
Any degree $p$ polynomial function $f_p$ can be identified by a set of coefficients $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_p \in \mathbb{R}$:

```{math}
f_p(x) = c_0  +  c_1 x + \ldots + c_{p-1}x^{p-1} + c_p x^p = \sum_{j=0}^p c_j x^j. 
```
:::{admonition} Task 1
:class: exercise

Write a function `compute_data_matrix(x, p)` that accepts an input vector `x` and a non-negative integer power `p`, and returns the corresponding polynomial data matrix as a `NumPy` array.


:::

:::{admonition} Task 2
:class: exercise

Use the following plotting code to be able to visualize a dataset of inputs `x` and outputs `y`.:

```python
def visualize_data(x, y):
   assert x.size == y.size 
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   ax.scatter(x, y)
   ax.set_xlabel('x')
   ax.set_ylabel('y')
   plt.show()
   return
```
Now, load in the following data, visualize it, and **determine a reasonable power** $p \in \mathbb{N}$ **for this dataset** by running the following:

```python
>>> data = np.load("polynomial_data.npz")
>>> x, y = data['x'], data['y']
>>> visualize_data(x, y)
```

(Here, *power* refers to the degree of the polynomial that fits the shape of the data.)


We now will compute the least squares fit for the data visualized previously.

We seek a set of coefficients $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that the corresponding degree polynomial **coefficient vector** $c \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}$ minimizes the **residual error**:

```{math}
\|Xc - y\|^2 \leq \|Xw - y\|^2 \text{ for all } w \in \mathbb{R}^{p+1}.
```
As discussed in class, the **normal equations** that characterize the **least squares solution** $\hat{c}$ are:

```{math}
X^TX \hat{c} = X^T y,
```
which is a linear system that we can use our linear algebra skills to solve. Under certain assumptions, the matrix $X^TX$ is invertible,
and so we can write the least squares solution as

```{math}
\hat{c} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y.
```
The least squares fit line then is defined as the degree $p$ polynomial

```{math}
\hat{f}_p(x) = \hat{c}_0 + \hat{c}_1 x + \ldots, \hat{c}_{p-1} x^{p-1} + \hat{c}_p x^p, 
```
which when applied to our set of inputs in the data matrix looks like $f = X \hat{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.


:::

::::{admonition} Task 3
:class: exercise

Replace any `...` to complete the function `plot_least_squares(x, y, p)` that will compute the least squares solution line and plot it against the data.
(Equations for $\hat{c}$ and $f$ are given above.)

```python
def plot_least_squares(x, y, p):
   assert x.size == y.size
   X = ...       # Compute data matrix with inputs x and polynomial power p using your compute_data_matrix function
   c_hat =  ...  # Compute the least-squares solution using X and y
   f = ...       # Compute the least-squares output, f = X @ c_hat
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   ax.scatter(x, y, label='orig data')  # this scatter plots the original data
   ax.plot(x, f, 'k--', label='LS fit') # this plots the least squares fit line 
   ax.set_xlabel('x')
   ax.set_ylabel('y')
   ax.legend()
   ax.set_title(f"Least Squares Polynomial fit with degree = {p}")
   plt.show()
   return
```
Description of inputs:

* input vector `x`
* output vector `y`
* desired polynomial power `p`


Using the data from Task 2, run your `plot_least_squares` function, trying different values of the polynomial power, $p$.
For example, try $p = 1, 2, 3, 5, 15$.

* What happens if you use a power $p<P$, where $P$ is the degree determined in Task 2?
* What happens if you use a *much larger* power than $P$?

:::{note}
In the task above, we computed the least-squares solution by solving the normal equations which involved inverting a matrix.
However, inverting a matrix is computationally expensive and can be numerically unstable.
This is why we solve for the least-squares solution by using the normal equations.
NumPy's numerical linear algebra library contains an optimized version of the least-squares method, called `numpy.linalg.lstsq`, so in the future you can use it to compute the least-squares solution instead.
Note that this still solves the normal equations, but it is more numerically stable and efficient.
You will need to view the documentation for `numpy.linalg.lstsq` to see how to use it.
See [the NumPy reference here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html) .

## Computing Linear Regression for Diabetes Data

We now turn to a "real-world" regression task of predicting diabetes progression based on patient information and medical measurements.
The data is from the [sklearn diabetes dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html).
It contains 442 samples with 10 features each.
And the features are: Age, Sex, Body Mass Index, Average Blood Pressure, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6.
Where S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 are the 6 blood serum measurements.
The target is the disease progression after 1 year of follow-up.
Let's compute a **linear regression** fit to the data in order to predict the disease progression; that is, we will identify coefficients
$\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_d \in \mathbb{R}$ to approximate the mapping $x_i \mapsto y_i$

```{math}
y_i \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \beta_2 x_{i,2} + \ldots + \beta_d x_{i,d} = \beta^T \begin{pmatrix} x_i \\ 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}.
```
Thus, with a set of data $\{x_i, y_i\}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$, we are computing the least squares fit with data matrix

```{math}
X = \begin{pmatrix}
   x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & \ldots & x_{1,d} & 1 \\
   x_{2,1} & x_{2,2} & \ldots & x_{2,d} & 1\\
   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
   x_{n,1} & x_{n,2} & \ldots & x_{n,d} & 1\\
\end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times (d+1)}
```
and output vector $y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$.


:::{admonition} Task 4
:class: exercise

Write a function `compute_diabetes_fit()` that computes the least squares fit coefficient vector $\hat{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ that is computed by `linalg.lstsq()`.
You may find the following code and guidelines to be useful:

```python
>>> diabetes_data = load_diabetes()                   # download the diabetes dataset
>>> X, y = diabetes_data.data, diabetes_data.target   # extract the data matrix (X) and targets (outputs) vector y
```

- Extend the data matrix with a column of ones to model the offset. **Hint:** [See the numpy function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.hstack.html) `numpy.hstack`.
- Compute the least-squares fit coefficient vector  via `numpy.linalg.lstsq` on this data.


To conclude, we now analyze the linear regression coefficient result vector, $\hat{\beta}$. The sign of an entry
of this coefficient vector indicates the whether or not there is a **positive** or **negative** correlation between the
corresponding input variable and the output data, conditioned on the other data. For example, if $\hat{\beta}_j >0$ and is **large**, then
holding all else equal, a small change in the $j^{th}$ feature will lead to a large, positive change in the output.
In context of this dataset, that means if the $\hat{\beta}$ of the age is positive and large, then a small change in age will lead to a large, positive change in the disease progression.

:::{admonition} Task 5
:class: exercise

Extend the capability of your previous function `compute_diabetes_fit()` to perform the following:

1. Extract the feature names of this dataset (`feature_names = diabetes_data.feature_names`)
2. Print out the feature names of the **most positive** and **most negative** regression coefficients. Record the names and values of those coefficients in CodeBuddy.

You can check out the description of all the different features (independent variables) in this diabetes dataset by
printing out

```python
>>> print(diabetes_data.DESCR)
```

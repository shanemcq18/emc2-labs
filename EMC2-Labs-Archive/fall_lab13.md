# Lab 13: Basis-finding



In this lab you will write a function that will compute a basis for a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$ spanned by a given set of vectors and any linear dependencies among the vectors.
You will want to use Sympy Matrix objects and the `rref` method for this lab.



## Task 1


Write a function `vec_basis(L)` that takes as input a list of vectors in  $\mathbb R^n$ and returns a basis for the subspace spanned by the vectors.
The input vectors should be given as lists.
If the vectors are of different lengths, your function should raise a `ValueError`.
The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a vector in the original list.
Your function should compute the basis following the procedure to compute a basis of the column space of a matrix.
Remember that the Sympy Matrix `rref` method returns a tuple, where the second value contains the indices of the columns which have leading terms.


```python
>>> vec_basis([[1,2],[2,1],[0,1]])
[[1, 2], [2, 1]]
```

```python
>>> vec_basis([[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]])
[[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]]
```




## Task 2



Write a function `lin_deps(L)` that takes as input a list of list of vectors in  $\mathbb R^n$ and returns a list of linear dependencies among the vectors.
The input vectors should be given as lists.
If the input vectors are of different lengths, your function should raise a `ValueError`.
The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list represents a linear dependence among the input vectors and should represent a basis for the null space of the matrix `A` whose column vectors are the input vectors.

You should have one output vector per free variable in the matrix equation `Ax=0`.
If `B` is the reduced echelon form of `A` and `x_i` is a free variable, we create the linear dependence corresponding to `x_i` as follows.

1. If `m` is the number of input vectors, create a list of length `m` where every entry is zero.

2. Change the `i` -th entry to a 1.

3. For each basic variable `x_j` let `k` be the index of the leading term in the `j` -th column of the reduced matrix so that `B[k,j] != 0`. Then set `j` -th entry of the list to `-B[k,i]`.



```python
>>> M=sp.Matrix([[1,2,3,4],[5,10,6,11]])
>>> M.rref()
(Matrix([
[1, 2, 0, 1],
[0, 0, 1, 1]]), (0, 2))
```

```python
>>> lin_deps([[1,5],[2,10],[3,6],[4,11]])
[[-2,1,0,0], [-1,0,-1,1]]
```


```python
>>> M=sp.Matrix([[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13,14,15]])
>>> M.rref()
(Matrix([
[1, 0, -1, -2, -3],
[0, 1,  2,  3,  4],
[0, 0,  0,  0,  0]]), (0, 1))
```

```python
>>> lin_deps ([[1,6,11],[2,7,12],[3,8,13],[4,9,14],[5,10,15]])
[[1,-2,1,0,0], [2,-3,0,1,0], [3,-4,0,0,1]]
```

# Lab 22: Determinants


In this lab you will write two functions to compute the determinant of a matrix.
The first method is recursive using the cofactor expansion of the matrix.
The second is much better and uses row reduction.
For our purposes we will use the `scipy.linalg` LU factorization method for the determinant.
You can read more about this method here:

<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lu.html>

The operations allowed in an LU factorization do not change the determinant of a matrix, so if `LU=A` is a factorization of `A`, then `det(A)=det(U)`.
Since `U` is upper triangular, its determinant is the product of entries down the main diagonal.

You can use the LU factorization method as follows.

```python
>>> import scipy.linalg as la
>>> la.lu([[1,2],[1,1]])
(array([[1., 0.],
[0., 1.]]), array([[1., 0.],
[1., 1.]]), array([[ 1.,  2.],
[ 0., -1.]]))
```

The output is a triple `(P,L,U)` where `P` is a permutation matrix, `L` is a lower-triangular matrix, and `U` is an upper triangular matrix.

:class: exercise




Write a function `det_rec(M)` which takes as input a matrix `M` and compute the determinant of a matrix recursively using the cofactor expansion.
Your base case should be when `M` is a `1 x 1` matrix, in which case the determinant is just the entry.

```python
>>> det_rec([[1,2],[1,1]])
-1.0
>>> det_rec([[1,2,3],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]])
-2.0
>>> det_rec([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0,1],[0,-1,0,-1,-2],
[1,1,1,1,1]])
-4.0
```

:::{admonition} Task 2
:class: exercise



Write a function `det_LU(M)` which takes as input a matrix `M` and compute the determinant of a matrix by first computing the LU factorization of `M` as described above, and then returning the product of values on the main diagonal of `U`.
For this problem, you should ignore the permutation matrix.
This will mean that your determinant is sometimes off by a sign since swapping rows changes the sign of the determinant.

```python
>>> det_LU([[1,2],[1,1]])
-1.0
>>> det_LU([[1,2,3],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]])
2.0
>>> det_LU([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0,1],[0,-1,0,-1,-2],
[1,1,1,1,1]])
4.0
```

Fix your `det_LU(M)` function so that it accounts for the change of sign indicated by the permutation matrix.

```python
>>> det_LU([[1,2],[1,1]])
-1.0
>>> det_LU([[1,2,3],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]])
-2.0
>>> det_LU([[1,2,3,4,5],[1,1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0,1],[0,-1,0,-1,-2],
[1,1,1,1,1]])
-4.0
```

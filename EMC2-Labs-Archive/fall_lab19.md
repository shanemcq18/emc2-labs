# Lab 19: Image Compression with SVD


In this lab you will perform image compression using singular value decomposition.
You will need to import the following:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import numpy.linalg as la
>>> import imageio as io
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> import scipy.misc
```


For this lab we will use a grayscale image of a racoon from the `scipy.misc` module, which can be accessed by

```python
>>> F = scipy.misc.face(gray=True)
```


To display the image, use the command

```python
>>> plt.imshow(F, cmap='gray')
```

The command `F.shape` shows that the image is stored as a numpy array of dimensions `m x n`.
These dimensions represent the coordinates of a pixel in the image with `(0,0)` in the top left corner.
The first dimension is the vertical dimension and the second is the horizontal dimension.
We can take a part of the image by using a command like

```python
>>> F1 = F[200:400, 500:700]
>>> plt.imshow(F1, cmap='gray')
```

Each entry is an integer representing how dark a pixel is (`0=black`, `255=white`).
Since `F` is a two-dimensional array we can treat it as a matrix and perform a singular value decomposition:

```python
>>> U,S,VT = la.svd(F)
```


Recall that the singular value decomposition writes $F$ in the form

```{math}
F = U\Sigma V^{T}.
```
The matrix $U$ is an $m \times m$ matrix with orthonormal columns, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ matrix with orthonormal columns.
$\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix whose nonzero entries are the singular values of $F$.
Python represents this as `S`, a list (numpy array) of the singular values of `F`.
The `np.diag` function will turn a list into a diagonal matrix.
If `r` is the length of `S`, the command

```python
>>> Ftest = U[:,:r].dot(np.diag(S[:r])).dot(VT[:r])
```

will create a matrix `Ftest` that is the same as `F` (up to Python precision issues).
If you display this as an image it will look indistinguishable from the original picture.
Python may complain about a potential loss of precision, but you may ignore this.
Now try using the command

```python
>>> Ftest = U[:,:s].dot(np.diag(S[:s])).dot(VT[:s])
```

for some `s<r`.
This is the rank `s` approximation of `F`.

## Task 1

Display the rank `s` approximation of the image for several values of `s`. What happens when `s=500`?
What about `s=100`? What about `s=1`?

## Task 2


How small can you make `s` and still have the image recognizable? Don't worry about a little graininess.

## Task 3

We can store a grayscale image as a list of integers of length `u+r+v`, where `u` (or `v`) is the number of entries
in `U` (or `V`). Stored that way, the amount of memory that the image takes up is proportional to that number `u+r+v`.
When we reduce `r` to the smaller number `s`, this reduces `u` and `v` as well to numbers `u(s)` and `v(s)`.
How does your choice of `s` in part (b) affect the amount of memory required to store the image? Compute the number
`u(s)+s+v(s)` for the SVD of `Ftest` for each choice of `s` as a percentage of `u+r+v`.

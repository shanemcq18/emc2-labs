# Lab 18: Modular Arithmetic


:::{admonition} Task 1
:class: exercise


An *elliptic curve* is an equation of the form

```{math}
E(a,b): y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
```
for fixed integers `a,b`.
For example, when we set `a=b=1` we get the elliptic curve

```{math}
E(1,1): y^2=x^3+x+1.
```
In cryptography, it is helpful to count the number of points on `E(a,b)` modulo some prime number `p`.
This means that we want to count the number of ordered pairs `(x,y)` with `0 <= x,y <= p-1` such that

```{math}
y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \pmod{p}.
```
Write a function `num_points(a,b,p)` that takes as input two integers `a` and `b` and a prime `p`, and returns the number of points on `E(a,b)` modulo `p`.


```python
>>> num_points(1,1,5)
8
>>> num_points(0,1,97)
83
```

:::{admonition} Task 2
:class: exercise


The textbook for Math 687R (a graduate number theory course at BYU) in Fall 2018 was *Auxiliary Polynomials in Number Theory* by David Masser.
One of the exercises in that book states: do there exist integers `a,b,c,d,e,f` such that `a != 0` and

```{math}
y^2 = ax^5+bx^4+cx^3+dx^2+ex+f
```
has no solutions modulo `11`?
The author states that he does not know the answer to this question.

Write a function `has_sol(a,b,c,d,e,f)` that takes in integers `a,b,c,d,e,f` and returns `True` if the equation has a solution modulo `11`, and `False` otherwise.


Find some `a,b,c,d,e,f`, all nonzero, such the equation above has no solutions modulo `11`.

:::{admonition} Task 3
:class: exercise



Write a program that finds every `n` in `[3,4,...,500]` that satisfies the congruence

```{math}
2^{n-1} \equiv 1\pmod{n}.
```
Save your list in a variable named `pseudoprimes`.


What do you notice about these `n`?
Is your observation true about *every* `n` in your list?

:::{admonition} Task 4
:class: exercise


Suppose that `p` is a prime number.
In this task you will write a program that does the following.
For every `n` in `[1,2,...,p-1]` find the smallest positive `k` such that

```{math}
n^k \equiv 1 \pmod{p},
```
if such a `k` exists.

Write a program `allk(p)` that takes a prime number `p` and outputs a list of length `p-1` consisting of all the `k` values asked for in this problem for the prime `p`.

Then, run the following code.

```python
for p in range(20,100):
  if isprime(p):
     print(p,': ', allk(p))
```
What do you notice about these values of `k`?
Formulate a conjecture (guess).

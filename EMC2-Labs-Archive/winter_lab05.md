# Lab 5: Planes, Trains and Automobiles

(Or how what was once "useless math" makes beautifully curved objects).
Over a century ago Bernstein introduced his now famous set of polynomials defined as

```{math}
B_j^n(x) = \left(\frac nj \right) x^j (1-x)^{n-j}, \text{ where } \left(\frac nj \right) = \frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!}.
```
These *Bernstein polynomials* were originally designed to give a constructive proof of the Stone–Weierstrass approximation theorem, which guarantees that any continuous function on a closed interval can be approximated as closely as desired by polynomials -- essentially deep theoretical math with limited application.
However, in the early 1960s two French engineers, de Casteljau and Bézier, independently used Bernstein polynomials to address a perplexing problem in the automotive design industry, namely how to specify "free-form" shapes consistently.
Their solution was to use Bernstein polynomials to describe parametric curves and surfaces with a finite number of points that control the shape of the curve or surface. This enabled the use of computers to sketch the curves and surfaces. The resulting curves are called *Bézier curves* and are of the form

```{math}
r(t) = \sum_{j=0}^n {\textbf p}_j B_j^n(t), \quad t\in [0,1],
```
where `p_0, ..., p_n` are the control points and `B_j^n(t)` are the Bernstein polynomials.
In this lab we will play with these Bézier curves, and a slick algorithm to create them called the de Casteljau algorithm.

At first glance, the formula for `r(t)` looks complicated to calculate.
De Casteljau gave a geometric algorithm to trace out a Bézier curve for an ordered set of `n` control points.
We will parameterize this curve between the first and last point with respect to `t`, letting `t` go from `0` to `1`.

:::{admonition} De Casteljau’s Algorithm
To evaluate the curve at a given time `t0` do the following:

- Parameterize the lines between each of the points letting `t` go from `0` to `1`. For the points `P_n` and `P_(n+1)` this parameterization is `P_n(1-t) + P_(n+1)(t)`. (Note, this is the most common way to parametrize a segment between two points.)

- Evaluate each of these parameterizations at `t0`. Note that this gives `n-1` new points.

- Repeat this process on the list of points until only one point is left. This is the value of the Bézier curve for these control points at the parameter `t0`.

Below is an illustration of the de Casteljau algorithm for `t0 = 0.25`.
The blue lines are what is called the *control polygon*. The green lines are the first parametrization, the red line is the second, and the red point is the point on the curve when `t0 = 0.25`.

The next three figures are illustrations of De Casteljau’s Algorithm for 3 points at `t0 = .5`, `.75`, and `1` respectively.

:::{admonition} Task 1
:class: exercise


Implement De Casteljau’s algorithm by writing a function `decasteljau(t, p)` that returns the location of a point on the Bézier curve determined by `p` at time `t`.
Your function should accept a `m x 2` array representing `m` control points, and a time `t0` at which to evaluate the curve. This looks much more scary then it actually is!

:::{admonition} Task 2
:class: exercise


Modify your code for De Casteljau's Algorithm, `decasteljau(t, p)`, to handle multiple time values (`t` as an `np.ndarray` input).

:::

:::{admonition} Task 3
:class: exercise


Create a function `plot_bezier(p)` to plot a Bézier curve in 2-D. Your function should accept a `m x 2` array representing `m` control points.
Use what you learned in {doc}`lab01` (i.e., `linspace()`, plotting tools) to create a curve that looks smooth.
